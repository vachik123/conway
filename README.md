Howdy! My submission is novel in a few ways, including an event visualization timeline, and measuring code quality alongside security.

For detection, I used online River models that were trained on LLM-labelled real and synthetic event data. To achieve this, I pull from repo contexts and use a sizable number of feature weights.

In other words, I have covered the bonus points section of the instructions.

Additionally, I've implemented a reset button so one could see the data populate from scratch.

For extra polish, I used Conway's font to experiment with the design language, and see what interfaces could be easily imagined in Conway's work.

I've used Claude Code to assist with this project.
